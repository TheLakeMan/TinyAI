# TinyAI Build Status Report

## Current Environment Setup

VS Code has been configured to use Visual Studio 2022 tools through the terminal with the following components:

1. **VS Code Configuration**:
   - `.vscode/tasks.json` - Build, run, and test tasks using VS2022 compiler
   - `.vscode/launch.json` - Debug configurations for the main app and tests
   - `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` - IntelliSense and code navigation setup
   - `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Developer PowerShell terminal integration

2. **Core Interpreter Fixes** (COMPLETED):
   - Fixed `picol.c` implementation to match declarations in `picol.h`
   - Added missing function implementations (picolCreateInterp, picolFreeInterp, etc.)
   - Added array handling functions
   - Fixed function signatures and return types
   - Added proper forward declarations and typedefs

## Current Build Status

The project now builds successfully and produces working executables. However, functionality is still limited. The following implementation steps are needed:

1. **Main Application**:
   - Main functionality builds but the application interface is minimal
   - Command-line argument handling needs to be improved
   - Shell functionality needs to be expanded

2. **Core Modules**:
   - Picol interpreter core is now fully implemented with all required functions
   - Memory and IO modules appear to be working correctly
   - Runtime environment needs further testing

## Next Implementation Steps

1. **Implement Tokenizer**:
   - Complete the implementation of `models/text/tokenizer.c`
   - Implement BPE vocabulary management
   - Add encoding/decoding functions

2. **Implement Text Generation**:
   - Complete the implementation of `models/text/generate.c`
   - Implement 4-bit matrix operations
   - Add model loading and forward pass implementation

3. **Complete Main Implementation**:
   - Enhance command-line argument handling in `main.c`
   - Implement interactive shell functionality
   - Add configuration loading and customization options

4. **Expand Test Suite**:
   - Add comprehensive unit tests for each component
   - Add integration tests for the full pipeline

## Using VS Code for TinyAI Development

To work on the TinyAI project using VS Code:

1. **Build the Project**:
   - Use VS Code tasks: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Build Debug"
   - Or run in terminal: `cmake --build build --config Debug`

2. **Run Tests**:
   - Use VS Code tasks: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Run Tests"
   - Or run in terminal: `build\Debug\tinyai_tests.exe`

3. **Debug the Project**:
   - Set breakpoints in code files
   - Use Run and Debug sidebar: `Ctrl+Shift+D`
   - Select "Debug TinyAI" or "Debug Tests" configuration

4. **Implement Missing Functionality**:
   - Use the Problems panel (`Ctrl+Shift+M`) to view compiler warnings
   - Follow the implementation plan to add features
   - Test each component as you implement it

The VS Code environment has been set up to provide a seamless development experience similar to Visual Studio 2022, but with the lightweight interface and terminal integration of VS Code.

## Recent Changes and Progress

- ✅ Fixed core interpreter implementation issues (`picol.c`)
- ✅ Implemented all required functions for the Picol interpreter
- ✅ Added array handling functionality
- ✅ Fixed function signature mismatches and return type issues
- ✅ Successfully built both the main application and tests

These changes have made significant progress toward a fully functional TinyAI implementation. The core interpreter is now working correctly, and we can move on to implementing the model components.
