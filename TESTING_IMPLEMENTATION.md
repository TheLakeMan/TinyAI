# TinyAI Testing Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the testing implementation for TinyAI's tokenizer and text generation modules, along with CLI enhancements to support these features.

## Implemented Components

### Test Files

1. **tests/test_tokenizer.c**
   - Tests for tokenizer creation/destruction
   - Tests for adding tokens to vocabulary
   - Tests for encoding/decoding text
   - Tests for handling unknown tokens
   - Tests for buffer limitations
   - Tests for saving/loading vocabulary
   - Tests for minimal BPE vocabulary creation

2. **tests/test_generate.c**
   - Tests for model creation/destruction
   - Tests for adding layers to models
   - Tests for model forward pass
   - Tests for sampling methods (greedy, top-k, top-p, temperature)
   - Tests for text generation with and without prompts

3. **Updated test_main.c**
   - Added support for running tokenizer and generation tests
   - Integration with existing test framework

### CLI Enhancements

1. **Tokenizer Command**
   - Implemented actual tokenization logic
   - Added token ID and string representation display
   - Added round-trip testing (decode after encode)

2. **Generate Command**
   - Added support for various sampling methods
   - Added CLI arguments for maxTokens, temperature, etc.
   - Implemented full text generation pipeline

3. **Model Command**
   - Added `create-vocab` subcommand for building vocabularies from text corpora
   - Enhanced model information display
   - Improved model loading/tokenizer loading

### Sample Data

Created sample text files for testing tokenization and text generation.

## Testing Methodology

The testing approach follows these principles:

1. **Unit Testing** - Tests for individual functions and components
2. **Integration Testing** - Tests for interactions between components
3. **Functional Testing** - Tests for end-to-end functionality

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Vocabulary

```
tinyai model create-vocab sample_text.txt 100 test-vocab.txt
```

### Tokenizing Text

```
tinyai tokenize "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
```

### Generating Text

```
tinyai generate "Once upon a time" 50 0.7 topk
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Larger Models** - Once larger models are available, test with more complex data
2. **Benchmark Performance** - Add performance metrics to tests
3. **Edge Cases** - Add tests for more edge cases and error conditions
4. **Automated Test Suite** - Enhance the automated test pipeline
