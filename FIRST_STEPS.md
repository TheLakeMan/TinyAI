# TinyAI: First Steps with Visual Studio 2022

This document outlines the immediate steps to take when first opening the TinyAI solution in Visual Studio 2022.

## First Session Checklist

1. **Open the solution**:
   - Launch Visual Studio 2022
   - Open `C:\Users\verme\OneDrive\Desktop\TinyAI\vs2022\TinyAI.sln`

2. **Examine the solution structure**:
   - Expand the solution in Solution Explorer
   - Note the main project (tinyai) and test project (tinyai_tests)
   - Examine CMake-generated projects (ALL_BUILD, ZERO_CHECK, etc.)

3. **Attempt a build to identify issues**:
   - Select Debug configuration
   - Build the solution (F7)
   - Note all errors in the Error List window

## Immediate Build Issues to Address

Based on our analysis, focus on fixing these issues first:

1. **First Priority: `picol.c`/`picol.h` mismatch issues**:
   - Open both files and examine function declarations vs implementations
   - Look for struct redefinitions (same struct defined multiple times)
   - Check function signatures (return types and parameter types)
   - Add `#ifndef`/`#define` guards if missing
   - Add `extern "C"` guards for C++ compatibility

2. **Second Priority: Linker errors**:
   - After fixing syntax errors, address any remaining linker errors
   - Focus on `picolRegisterCommand` and `picolSetResult` implementations
   - Check for missing function implementations

3. **Third Priority: Include path issues**:
   - Verify the include paths in header files
   - Make sure each header references other headers correctly

## Specific Files to Check

1. **core/picol.h**:
   - Check for missing include guards
   - Verify struct definitions
   - Confirm function declarations

2. **core/picol.c**:
   - Make sure it includes `picol.h` correctly
   - Verify all function implementations match declarations
   - Check for duplicated struct definitions

3. **CMakeLists.txt**:
   - Verify it includes all necessary source files
   - Check for correct include directories

## Implementation Tasks After Build Fixes

After resolving build issues, start implementing:

1. **Picol Interpreter Core**:
   - Complete the core functions in `picol.c`
   - Test basic interpreter functionality

2. **Tokenizer**:
   - Implement BPE tokenization in `models/text/tokenizer.c`
   - Add vocabulary management functions

3. **Text Generation**:
   - Implement 4-bit matrix operations
   - Add forward pass for transformer/RNN models

## First Test Run

Once the build issues are fixed:

1. Set `tinyai` as the startup project
2. Run in debug mode (F5)
3. Verify basic functionality works
4. Run the test suite to confirm components work correctly

## Incremental Progress Strategy

1. **Fix one issue at a time**:
   - Start with the first file that has errors
   - Fix all errors in that file before moving to the next
   - Re-build frequently to check progress

2. **Document as you go**:
   - Update the PROJECT_STATUS.md file with your progress
   - Note any changes to function signatures or designs

3. **Use incremental testing**:
   - Test each component independently before integration
   - Create simple test cases for new functionality

## If All Else Fails

If you encounter persistent build issues:

1. Consider recreating the solution with more specific CMake parameters
2. Check Visual Studio version compatibility
3. Try building from command line to isolate Visual Studio-specific issues:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\verme\OneDrive\Desktop\TinyAI\vs2022
   cmake --build . --config Debug
   ```

## Next Session Focus

After this first session and addressing build issues, the next session should focus on:

1. Testing the fixed core components
2. Completing the tokenizer implementation
3. Setting up test cases for each component
