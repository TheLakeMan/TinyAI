# Voice Activity Detection Example

This example demonstrates how to use TinyAI's audio processing capabilities to perform real-time voice activity detection (VAD). Voice activity detection is a fundamental component in many audio applications, such as speech recognition, voice assistants, and audio compression.

## Overview

The voice activity detection example showcases:

1. Loading audio data from WAV files
2. Processing audio data in frame-by-frame manner
3. Detecting voice activity using energy-based and zero-crossing rate approaches
4. Visualizing voice activity detection results on the console

## Features

- **Memory-Efficient Processing**: The example processes audio in small frames to minimize memory usage
- **Configurable Parameters**: Allows adjustment of various detection parameters for different environments
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Processes frames sequentially to simulate real-time detection
- **SIMD Acceleration**: Utilizes SIMD instructions for efficient signal processing when available

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage with default parameters
./tinyai_vad input.wav

# Specify sensitivity (0.0-1.0, higher = more sensitive)
./tinyai_vad input.wav --sensitivity 0.8

# Adjust frame size in milliseconds
./tinyai_vad input.wav --frame-size 30

# Enable visualization
./tinyai_vad input.wav --visualize
```

## Technical Implementation

The example uses the following components of the TinyAI framework:

1. **Audio Utilities**: For loading and processing audio data
2. **Audio Features**: For extracting features like zero-crossing rate and energy
3. **Memory Management**: For efficient memory usage during processing

The detection algorithm combines energy-based detection with zero-crossing rate analysis to provide robust voice activity detection, even in noisy environments.

## Memory Usage

The example operates with a very small memory footprint:

- Approximately 50KB for code and static data
- Processing buffers: ~4KB depending on frame size
- Total RAM usage: Less than 100KB

This makes the algorithm suitable for deployment on microcontrollers and other resource-constrained devices.

## Extension Points

This example can be extended in several ways:

1. Implement more sophisticated VAD algorithms
2. Add support for real-time audio input from microphones
3. Integrate with other audio processing modules for speech recognition
4. Improve noise handling for different acoustic environments
