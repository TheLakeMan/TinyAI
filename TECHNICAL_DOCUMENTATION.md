### Key Design Principles

1. **Minimal Resource Usage**: Every component is designed with extreme resource efficiency in mind, targeting systems with as little as 50-100MB of RAM.

2. **4-bit Quantization**: Neural network weights are quantized to 4 bits (16 values) to minimize memory footprint while maintaining reasonable accuracy.

3. **Progressive Loading**: Components are loaded on-demand and can be unloaded when not in use to minimize memory consumption.

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The system is designed to work on a wide range of platforms, from legacy Windows 95 systems to modern hardware.

5. **Modular Design**: Each component is self-contained and can be used independently, allowing for flexible deployment options.

- CPU: Single-core performance optimization (no external dependencies)
- Performance Target: 1-5 tokens per second on 90s-era hardware

## Data Flow

The typical data flow for text generation:

1. **Input Processing**: Text input is tokenized using a minimal vocabulary tokenizer
2. **Model Inference**: 4-bit quantized neural network processes tokens
3. **Progressive Generation**: Text is generated token by token with minimal memory overhead
4. **Output Formatting**: Generated tokens are decoded back to text

## Memory Management

Memory is managed through several specialized components:

1. **Memory Pools**: Fixed-size block allocation for efficient memory reuse
2. **4-bit Quantization**: Neural network weights stored with 2 values per byte
3. **Progressive Loading**: Model components loaded on-demand
4. **Resource Tracking**: All resources tracked and automatically released

## API Cost Management ($5.00 Budget)

To stay within the $5.00 API cost budget:

1. Implement a highly optimized tokenizer to minimize token usage
2. Focus on smaller model architectures (50-100M parameters)
3. Use aggressive quantization to 4-bit precision
4. Prioritize inference over training capabilities
5. Implement knowledge distillation methods to compress larger models
