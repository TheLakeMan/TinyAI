# TinyAI Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for TinyAI, including all required files, their purpose, and implementation details.

## Overview

TinyAI is an ultra-lightweight AI model framework designed to run on minimal hardware, including legacy systems as old as Windows 95. The implementation focuses on extreme efficiency through 4-bit quantization, minimal memory footprint, and CPU-only execution.

- Interface components (`cli.c`, `main.c` - root main used)
- Model headers (`tokenizer.h`, `generate.h`) and basic implementations (`tokenizer.c`, `generate.c`)
- Utility components (`quantize.h`, `quantize.c`)

## Implementation Testing

### 1. Tokenizer Testing Plan (tokenizer.c)

The implemented tokenizer should be tested with:

- ✅ Vocabulary loading/saving
- ✅ BPE merges with different priority levels
- ✅ Special token handling (UNKNOWN, BOS, EOS, PAD)
- Encoding/decoding round-trip validation
- Case-sensitivity options
- Memory efficiency measurements

### 2. Text Generation Testing Plan (generate.c)

The implemented text generation should be tested with:

- 4-bit quantization accuracy validation
- Matrix operation correctness for both RNN and Transformer models
- Sampling methods (greedy, top-k, top-p, temperature)
- Inference speed measurements
- Memory usage profiling
- Context handling with different sizes

### 3. Quantization Utilities (quantize.c)

Quantization will support both 4-bit and 8-bit precision:

- Linear quantization with zero-point
- Lookup tables for activation functions
- SIMD optimizations where available
- Fallback to scalar operations for older CPUs
- Memory-efficient matrix storage formats

### 4. Knowledge Retrieval (retrieval.c)

The reasoning module will use compressed vector representations:

- 4-bit quantized knowledge vectors
- Approximate nearest neighbor search
- Disk-based index with progressive loading
- Simplified scoring and ranking

### 5. Vision Processing Plan (extract.c) - Future Work

The vision module will be implemented in a future phase:

- 8-bit quantization for feature extraction
- Basic edge and corner detection
- Fixed-size feature descriptors
- Quantized CNN operations
- Memory-mapped image processing

## Performance Targets

The implementation meets the following resource constraints:

- ✅ Memory: 50-100MB RAM total (current implementation)
- ✅ Storage: 200-500MB depending on capabilities
- ✅ CPU: Single-core performance optimization (no external dependencies)
- ⚠️ Performance Target: 1-5 tokens per second on 90s-era hardware (needs benchmarking)

## API Cost Management ($5.00 Budget)

To stay within the $5.00 API cost budget, we will:

1. Implement a highly optimized tokenizer to minimize token usage
2. Focus on smaller model architectures (50-100M parameters)
3. Use aggressive quantization to 4-bit precision
4. Prioritize inference over training capabilities
5. Implement knowledge distillation methods to compress larger models
